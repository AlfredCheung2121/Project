From the above data, we can see the following: - For the average number of years men spend in school, majority of the countries last around 4-10 years. - For that of women, there is a decreasing trend on the average number of years spent in school. - Most countries included in the data have an employment percentage around 60%. - Whereas, the unemployment percentage generally ranges from 0-15% for most countries. - The literacy rate shows an increasing trend, where most countries listed have literacy percentages above 50%.\n\nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))\ncorr = df.corr()\nhm = sns.heatmap(round(corr,4), annot=True, ax=ax, cmap=\"coolwarm\",fmt='.2f',\n                 linewidths=.1)\nf.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)\nt= f.suptitle('Attributes Correlation Heatmap', fontsize=18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur group also tried to create a heat map to try and look for any correlations among the different attributes we’ve selected.\nFrom the heat map, the correlation of employment rate with literacy rate and average number of years in school for both men and women show a negative relation. The negative correlations imply that as the employment rate increases, the literacy rate and the average number of years are lower.\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\nxs = df['Avg.

We chose three attributes among the five above, namely employment rate, literacy rate, and the average number of years in school among men.\nAs of now, we can see that the countries on the scatterplot are quite spread out sporadically, so there is no clear correlation between the literacy rate and average years in school, with a country’s employment rate.\n\n\nCorrelation and Dimensionality Reduction\nIn this part of the project, our group will first try to reduce the dimension of our data then visualize it similarly as above.\n\n#The next parts are linked to the 3D plot created above\n\ncols = ['Employment Rate', 'Literacy Rate', 'Avg.

Even after using dimensionality reduction, there is no distinct relationship among the variables we have presented.\n\n\nRegression\nAt this point of our project, we will apply linear regression and high-dimensional regression. Firstly, we’ll be using a scatterplot to view the current distribution.\n\nx = df['Employment Rate']\ny = df['Literacy Rate']\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nfig.subplots_adjust(top=1)\n\nplt.scatter(x, y)\nplt.title('Linear to Employment Rate')\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Linear to Employment Rate')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nx = np.array(x).reshape((-1, 1))\nmodel.fit(x, y)\n\nr_sq = model.score(x, y)\nprint('Coefficient of determination:', r_sq)\nprint('Intercept:', model.intercept_)\nprint('Slope:', model.coef_)\n\ny_pred = model.predict(x)\n\nCoefficient of determination: 0.07071682385809042\nIntercept: 1.0422346132424825\nSlope: [-0.47367135]\n\n\nThis regression results in a model like:\n\\[ Literacy Rate = 1.04223 + (-0.47367) \\times Employment Rate \\]\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nfig.subplots_adjust(top=0.8)\nplt.scatter(x, y)\nplt.title('Literacy to Employment Rate')\n\nplt.plot(x, y_pred, color = 'red')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying linear regression, we find a predicted relationship - one that opposes the hypothesis made in the beginning of our project. The prediction line highlights that as the employment rate increases, the literacy rate drops from around 90% to 60-70%.\n\nx = df[['Avg. Years in School (M)', 'Avg. Years in School (W)']]\ny = df['Employment Rate']\n\n\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(x, y)\n\nr_sq = model.score(x, y)\nprint('coefficient of determination:', r_sq)\nprint('intercept:', model.intercept_)\nprint('slope:', model.coef_)\n\ncoefficient of determination: 0.06582054844731555\nintercept: 0.6403955359315295\nslope: [-0.01489153  0.00265219]\n\n\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\n\nxs = df['Avg. Years in School (M)']\nys = df['Avg. Years in School (W)']\nzs = df['Employment Rate']\nax.scatter(xs, ys, zs, s=30, alpha=0.6, edgecolors='w', color = 'red')\n\nax.set_xlabel('Avg. Years in School (M)')\nax.set_ylabel('Avg. Years in School (W)')\nax.set_zlabel('Employment Rate')\n\nxp = np.linspace(min(df['Avg. Years in School (M)']),max(df['Avg. Years in School (M)']),11)\nyp = np.linspace(min(df['Avg. Years in School (W)']),max(df['Avg. Years in School (W)']),11)\nx,y = np.meshgrid(xp, yp)\nz = model.intercept_ + model.coef_[0]*x + model.coef_[1]*y\n\nax.scatter(x,y,z, alpha=0.2, color = 'steelblue')\n\nplt.draw()\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to that of the 2D scatterplot above, the countries are scattered and there is not a clear pattern, but a possible prediction. However, there is no distinct relationship between the average years in school of both men and women, with their country’s employment rate.\n\n\nClassification and Clustering\nFinally, we will apply classification and clustering methods to our data.\n\n#Add all your code here\n\n\n\nLimitations\nWithin this project, though we have generated reasonable results, there were a few limitations we faced, possibly affecting its accurary.\n\nCompiling into one dataframe: After generating the mean for each attribute, we concatenated these into one dataframe. However, because each attribute had their own number of countries for data provided, the concatenated dataframe resulted in some cells containing “NaN”. With this, we chose to drop the rows that had “NaN” to prevent any programming malfunctions or limitations.\n\n\n\nSummary\nTo summarize, our group constructed a conjecture, “A country’s employment rate is mainly dependent on the prevalence and affluence of their education system”, to identify to what extent a country’s education system is a factor to their employment rates.\nIn our project, we included data involving employment and unemployment rates, literacy rates, and mean years in school. We used different statistical analysis methods to identify any form of relationship or dependence, whether causal or not. Our hypothesis was that the greater prevalence and affluence of a country’s education system, the higher their employment rate will be.\nMajority of our results mainly concluded that there is no direct relationship between the different attributes we have selected, but some of our approaches revealed a predicted pattern, such as when we used linear regression. However, the predicted relationship showed an opposing direction, that the greater the employment rate, the more average the literacy rate.\nTherefore, our group declares the conjecture to be inaccurate, that a country’s employment rate DOES NOT mainly depend on the prevalence and affluence of their education system."
