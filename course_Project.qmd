In this project, our group aims to verify whether receiving education, and to what extent, is the main factor to being employed.

For this project, we will make a few assumptions:
- the prevalence and affluene of a country's education system is directly linked to the overall literacy rate, as well as mean years of school for both men and women

Our hypothesis for this conjecture is that the greater prevalence and affluence of a country's education system, the higher their employment rate will be.
